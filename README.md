# Web-Design-Challenge

This project was to setup a visualization dashboard using the visualizations that were created by plotting weather data from cities around the globe.  The visualizations that were created compared the following:

1. Lattitude vs. Maximum Temprature
2. Lattitude vs. Humidity
3. Lattitude vs. Cloudiness
4. Lattitude vs. Wind Speed

After we created the visualizations we were tasked with determiining if there was any correlation between lattitude and the weather factors listed above.  What we determined is that the only weather factor where there was a correlation was "Maximum Temprature" and that is basically due to the tilt of the earth where the equator is always closest to the sun.  

You can navigate by either clicking on the visualization or by using the navigation bar at the top.  Using the navigation bar you can click "Lattitude" which will always bring you back to the "Home" screen and you also have the option of clicking on the "Data" option to see all of the cities that were selectedd for this study.
